@peter_strange asked me to anwser the post (it seems that because of my other unfinished library, a port of PDF Renderer, I am being viewed as knowledgable on PDF). I said what I knew
then wanted to see if I could make a quick mock up of a program. I did in a few hours and an ample amount of reading the PDF standard. Instead of simply posting up the code in the forum,
I decided to actually make a library for it.

It was originally written in C# and ported to BlackBerry. The original C# code is located in the Other folder.
The code written for the forum post is also located in the Other folder.
